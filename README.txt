1.	Explain which programs/features work 
Program 1: Max part works in which 10 out 10 test cases passed. 
However, min part does not work in which 8 out 10 test cases passed. 

Program 2: In min part, 8 test cases for min passed. 

Program 3: We can complie the code or sometimes result in infinite loop but have not passed test cases despite tremendous effort. 

We run our project on EDAplayground so that we have a deisgn file. 


2.	Explain which programs/features donâ€™t work and what challenges you faced when implementing your design.
The design and debugging part is hard. We spent a lot of time designing and discussing what the instruction format should be, especially how many number of bits for opcode, registers, addresses, etc. In program 1, the min part does not work maybe because the assembly and Ctrl is wrong. But we printed out the process which is correct in that memory is keep updating. In program 2, 8 test cases passed and that the rest did not maybe due to the ALU process. In program 3, it compiles and that we are still figuring out why the test cases does not pass. 

When debug, we find out many bugs that we did not expect, and some of which we spend too much time to figure why is not working. 

We actually write three versions of ISA, in which the last versions has a lot of improvments. 



3.	Include the link and passcode to your zoom video (see above) 
We have two videos since we cut off in the middle
Link: https://ucsd.zoom.us/rec/share/OdSm2aopJ0xHg3WfPJtEjqQ8oWqBowg6QRlmHAm6lSDJuAVyc5QpBC2iYdwVCgGt.RjMwEkO-Cc-CwNwO
Passcode: P%w3AF+K

We are able to make updates to our files after this video so that we passed more test cases but we can't record it due to Zoom cloud issues in which we lose footages.
